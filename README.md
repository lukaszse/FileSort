# FileSort
This is a simple application for sorting files to appropriate folders according to internally hardcoded rules.

## Build app
1. Build app with gradle: \
`gradle clean build` 
2. The built app is located in the following location: \
`build/libs/FilesSort-0.1-all.jar` 
3. run app `java -jar FilesSort-0.1-all.jar`
app can e invoked optionally with paameter `path`, example: \
   `java -jar FilesSort-0.1-all.jar -p {your chosen path}`

## How it works?
Each time app is launch, it copies all files from ./home to ./dev or ./test \
Criteria:
+ ./dev - `*.xml` and `*.jar` with even hour
+ ./test - `*.jar` with even odd

## Scheduler
Currently, this app does not have implemented any internal scheduler. System scheduler as cron can be used.


## Requirements
